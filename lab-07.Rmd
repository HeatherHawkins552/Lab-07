### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
```

### Exercise 1

This visualization is misleading because there are TWO DIFFERENT types of scales. Masked mandated counties are scaled from 15-25 while no-mask mandated counties counts are scaled from 4-14. If you DEEPLY look at this data, no-mask county counts are VERY low ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡

```{R data}

df1 <- data.frame(id = c(1,2),
                  name = c('MASK','Nomask'))
MASK_data <- tribble(
  ~type, ~date, ~count,
  "Mask", "7/12/2020", 25.3,
  "Mask", "7/13/2020", 19.8,
  "Mask", "7/14/2020", 19.8,
  "Mask", "7/15/2020", 20.5,
  "Mask", "7/16/2020", 19.8,
  "Mask", "7/17/2020", 19.8,
  "Mask", "7/18/2020", 20.5,
  "Mask", "7/19/2020", 20,
  "Mask", "7/20/2020", 20.7,
  "Mask", "7/21/2020", 21.2,
  "Mask", "7/22/2020", 19.9,
  "Mask", "7/23/2020", 19.9,
  "Mask", "7/24/2020", 20.5,
  "Mask", "7/25/2020", 19,
  "Mask", "7/26/2020", 19.5,
  "Mask", "7/27/2020", 17,
  "Mask", "7/28/2020", 16,
  "Mask", "7/29/2020", 16.3,
  "Mask", "7/30/2020", 16.4,
  "Mask", "7/31/2020", 16,
  "Mask", "8/1/2020", 16.2,
  "Mask", "8/2/2020", 15.8,
  "Mask", "8/3/2020", 15.9,
  "No Mask", "7/12/2020", 9.9,
  "No Mask", "7/13/2020", 9,
  "No Mask", "7/14/2020", 9.3,
  "No Mask", "7/15/2020", 9.9,
  "No Mask", "7/16/2020", 9.95,
  "No Mask", "7/17/2020", 9.5,
  "No Mask", "7/18/2020", 9.5,
  "No Mask", "7/19/2020", 9,
  "No Mask", "7/20/2020", 8.5,
  "No Mask", "7/21/2020", 8.5,
  "No Mask", "7/22/2020", 8.6,
  "No Mask", "7/23/2020", 8.5,
  "No Mask", "7/24/2020", 9.9,
  "No Mask", "7/25/2020", 9.95,
  "No Mask", "7/26/2020", 10.01,
  "No Mask", "7/27/2020", 9.5,
  "No Mask", "7/28/2020", 9.5,
  "No Mask", "7/29/2020", 9.55,
  "No Mask", "7/30/2020", 10,
  "No Mask", "7/31/2020", 8.8,
  "No Mask", "8/1/2020", 9,
  "No Mask", "8/2/2020", 8.8,
  "No Mask", "8/3/2020", 9,
)

```

Because of this, I ACTUALLY counted these counts of covid-19 for each type of county. 


### Exercise 2
```{R Plot}
MASK_data %>%
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = date,
                  y = count, 
                  color= type)) +
  geom_point()

```

### Exercise 3

As you can see, reformatting the scale to fit both types and adding the true numbers shoe that counties with no-mask mandates actually had LESS cases of COVID-19 than counties with mask mandates. 

### Exercise 4

This information tells us that 1: Counties without a mask mandate had less cases of COVID than counties with a mask mandate and that 2: wearing a mask doesn't completelty protect you from catching COVID. 

Overall, initially looking at the data- it seems to say that masks do not work at all, but that is not the case. Counties with the most cases overall benefitted from the mask mandate- while those without a mask mandate didnt need masks, because their cases were already low. 

There are several reasons why this could be happening. One possible reason could be due to the pop. density. If there were more people in one area, then masks would be needed, and then mask mandates would occur. On the other hand, counties with low pop. densities would already have few cases and therefore not need a mandate.
